                                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Smartphone overuse is hyper-prevalent in society, and developing tools to prevent this overuse has become a focus of HCI. However, there is a lack of work investigating smartphone overuse interventions over the long term. We collected historical usage data from 1,039 users of one sec over an average of 13.4 weeks and qualitative insights from 249 of the users through an online survey. We found that users overwhelmingly choose to target Social Media apps. We found that the short design frictions introduced by one sec effectively reduce how often users attempt to open target apps and lead to more intentional app-openings over time. Additionally, we found that users take periodic breaks from one sec interventions, and quickly rebound from a pattern of overuse when returning from breaks. Overall, we contribute findings from a longitudinal investigation of design frictions in the wild and identify usage patterns from real users in practice.</p>
    
                                        <p><strong>Application:</strong> As the first large-scale evaluation of design-friction smartphone overuse interventions in the wild, our results provide crucial insights into the effectiveness of these approaches. We found that design frictions are effective in reducing unwanted smartphone use over the long term, and that the largest drop in use occurs in the first three weeks.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditional meetings involve extensive sitting, which negatively impacts the health of attendees. Understanding how technology can facilitate integrating physical activity into the workplace, such as in walking meetings, is vital to improving workplace wellbeing. However, while walking meetings offer a healthy alternative to sit-down meetings, they also pose practical challenges. In a series of mixed-method evaluations, we sought to understand the needs and opportunities for walking meetings and develop a prototype to support note-taking while walking. To this end, we first conducted an online questionnaire (N=91) and a series of interviews with early adopters (N=6) . Based on our findings, we created design fictions and elicited feedback through a second online questionnaire (N=80) and a second round of interviews with the early adopters. We identified barriers and developed design opportunities for technology-supported walking meetings. One major challenge we identified was note-taking while talking, so we developed a functional prototype in the form of a walking stick. We evaluated the Walking Talking Stick with users (N=60) who conducted meetings in an outdoor setting. We found that the prototype gives users the confidence to conduct more complex meetings on the move, increases task focus, and facilitates turn-taking.</p>
    
                                        <p><strong>Application:</strong> Our results have two major contributions. First, the knowledge generated from the initial investigation into barriers and opportunities provides a strong foundation to inform future designers. The findings can be used as a starting point to identify core problems and develop solutions. Second, through our prototype evaluation, we have demonstrated that technology can improve walking meeting effectiveness without reducing the experience. Our prototype could be deployed in real workplaces in the future to facilitate increased physical activity.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Sedentary behavior is endemic in modern workplaces, contributing to negative physical and mental health outcomes. Although adjustable standing desks are increasing in popularity, people still avoid standing. We developed an open-source plug-and-play system to remotely control standing desks and investigated three system modes with a three-week in-the-wild user study (N=15). Interval mode forces users to stand once per hour, causing frustration. Adaptive mode nudges users to stand every hour unless the user has stood already. Smart mode, which raises the desk during breaks, was the best rated, contributing to increased standing time with the most positive qualitative feedback. However, non-computer activities need to be accounted for in the future. Therefore, our results indicate that a smart standing desk that shifts modes at opportune times has the most potential to reduce sedentary behavior in the workplace. We contribute our open-source system and insights for future intelligent workplace well-being systems.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Axem Pro Headset is a medical device that uses functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activity and provide feedback to stroke rehabilitation patients. The device is the first product from Axem Neurotechnology, a startup from Halifax, Canada.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Role:</strong> As the Mechanical Lead and first engineering hire, I was in charge of designing and testing the mechanical aspects of the headset. In this role, I used CAD and engineering principles to design the headset to fit multiple headshapes, be robust, and  provide accurate measurements. I worked with the electrical team and manufacturing houses in Shenzhen, China to optimize the design for effectiveness and manufacturability. I also researched light properties to design the headset materials to optimize for performance of the fNIRS measurements.</p>
    
                                        <p><strong>Application:</strong> My design and engineering work contributed to a successful patent application. When the product is made available to the public, it has the potential to provide profound benefits to patients who experience motor impairments from strokes.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> My co-founder and I developed Mindpalace, a digital second brain that lets users save insights from any media format (podcasts, articles, etc.). As CTO, I led the technical side of the product. I conducted user interviews, surveys, and usage analyses and led the full-stack development of the mobile and desktop apps. I won pitching awards, raised funds, and we were accepted to multiple accelerators.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Social interaction is a crucial part of what it means to be human.
                                            Maintaining a healthy social life is strongly tied to positive outcomes for both physical and mental health. While we use personal informatics data to reflect on many aspects of our lives, technology-supported reflection for social interactions is currently under-explored. To address this, we first conducted an online survey (𝑁 =124) to understand how users want to be supported in their social interactions. Based on this, we designed and developed an app for users to track and reflect on their social interactions and deployed it in the wild for two weeks (𝑁 =25). Our results show that users are interested in tracking meaningful in-person interactions that are currently untraced and that an app can effectively support self-reflection on social interaction frequency and social load. We contribute insights and concrete design recommendations for technology-supported reflection for social interaction.</p>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/hawaii.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I'm an avid adventurer in all seasons. In summers I love long distance hiking, camping, and bouldering. When the weather gets frosty I freeride and backcountry ski and play hockey.
                                I also travel, practice yoga, and (try to) play guitar.<br />
                                I was born and raised in the small town of Antigonish on the east coast of Canada. Since then, I've lived around the world in Halifax, Vancouver, Shenzhen, and Munich.
